EXECUTION STEPS

1.	Create your script file
  vi [script_file_name].sh

2.	Give an “execution  permission" to the [script_file_name].sh
  sudo chmod +x [script_file_name].sh

3.	Schedule your cron job
  crontab -e

4.	To check or list your available/schedule cron job
  crontab -l

5.	To check or list your available/schedule cron job
  crontab -l

6.	Remove Crontab:
To remove all crontab entries for the current user, use the following command:
  crontab -r

Remember to save your changes after editing the crontab file, and the “cron daemon” will take care of executing the scheduled commands at the specified intervals. 

Make sure you use caution when scheduling tasks, especially if they involve critical operations. 

Always test your scripts and commands before adding them to a crontab.


To stop a cron job, you need to remove or comment out the corresponding entry in the crontab file. Follow these steps to stop a cron job:

Open the crontab for editing:

  crontab -e

Locate the line that represents the cron job you want to stop. It will have the same syntax as that you whan to stop:

* * * * * “command_to_be_executed”

To stop the cron job, either:
  1.	Remove the entire line or 
  2.	Comment it out by adding a # at the beginning of the line.
